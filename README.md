# mxnet_predict ros package

This repository contains a ros package that compiles the amalgamation
version of [MXNet](http://mxnet.io), which can be used for
prediction/inference using a pretrained model.

To compile the package, all you need is having the BLAS library and a recent
C++ compiler installed.
